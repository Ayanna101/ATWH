        <h3>INFO</h3>
        <p>AROUND-THE-WORLD-HANGMAN is a redesigned verion of the original game hangman. In this version each level you are in a different part of the world. You will be challenged to guess a word that corrensponds with the place you are in. For example... If you are in Mexico the game will generate a word that relates to Mexico, like "taco". You have 5 lives, if you lose a life you can either buy a life or wait for the timer to end.</p>

        <h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>
        <p>You are given a random word to guess. You guess the world by typing a letter, if the letter is correct it will show on the screen and you then have to guess again until you complete the word. If you guess the wrong letter you will lose a life.</p>
